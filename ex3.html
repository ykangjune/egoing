    <span id="first" class="js">JavaScript</span> (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[8] often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[9] <span class="js">JavaScript</span> is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Alongside HTML and CSS, <span class="js">JavaScript</span> is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[10] Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,[11] often incorporating third-party libraries.[12] All major web browsers have a dedicated <span class="js">JavaScript</span> engine to execute the code on the user's device.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a multi-paradigm language, <span>JavaScript</span> supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
  </p>
  <p>
    The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides <span>JavaScript</span> APIs for I/O.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>JavaScript</span> engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now core components of other software systems, most notably servers and a variety of applications.
